I am Cătălin Mihai Popoiu, a student in class CB03 of Semester 2 at Fontys University of Applied Sciences.

This is my Git repository for my individual project of this semester, a speedrunning website built for gamers.

This project will be build using ASP.NET Razor Pages and Windows Forms (C#).

My project is envisioned as a place where gamers can compete against each others in speedrunning different games. They can also just upload their times to keep track of their own data.
Gamers can see games, upload their speedrunning submissions, where they are required to also provide a link to a video of their submission.

This project is meant to enhance user's gaming experience, as they can compete against each others and set fun challenges for themselves.
